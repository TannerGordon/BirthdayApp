# Birthday! Mobile App

Coming soon to the AppStore!!!




---
Birthday! is a mobile app that will ensure that you never miss a friend's birthday again. Upon downloading the app, you enter your name and your birthday. Then, you decide when you would like to receive notifications for your friends' birthdays (ex. the day of, one day before, one week before, etc.). Finally, you can sync your contacts, and anyone who already has the app will be automatically added and you won't have to enter their birthday!

Inspiration for this app:
  I am terrible with remembering my friends' birthdays and I've always wanted an app that would notify me when their birthday is coming up.
