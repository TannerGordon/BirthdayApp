  <b>Birthday! Mobile App</b>
  <br>
</h1>

<h4 align="center"><b>Birthday!</b> is a mobile app that will ensure that you never miss a friend's birthday again</a>.
<br>

# How it Works

Upon downloading the app, you enter your name and your birthday. Then, you decide when you would like to receive notifications for your friends' birthdays (ex. the day of, one day before, one week before, etc.). Finally, you can sync your contacts, and anyone who already has the app will be automatically added and you won't have to enter their birthday!

# Inspiration for the app

I am pretty bad at remembering my friends' birthdays and I've always wanted an app that would remind me when a friend's brithday is coming up!
